We sequence genetic material from sources as diverse as air, wastewater, groundwater, and seawater to identify and forecast pathogen outbreaks.\n\n\nOpen Data\nWe believe science progresses fastest in the open. Our projects comply with rigorous standards for data availability, including submission to public repositories like the Sequence Read Archive.\n\n\n\n\nScientific Reproducibility\nWithout reproducability, science can never progress. In line with our commitment to data availability, we go to great lengths to make our analyses reproducible and transparent. We believe code will be read many more times that it will be written, which is no less true for research software.\n\n\nOpen Source\nAll our projects are open source with a permissive license, making it more likely that our data and methods will be re-used by future scientists. Open source also gives us tools for managing contributions from across our team and from collaborators.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in collaborating?\nGet In Touch\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
