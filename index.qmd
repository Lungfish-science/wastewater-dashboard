Welcome to the **lung.fish** initiative's public health data explorer, a growing collection of dashboards driven by environmental monitoring data:

-   [SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Monitoring](dashboard1.qmd)

```{python}
#| classes: '.g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 .g-col-md-12'
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

import yaml
from IPython.display import HTML, display
from wastewater_dashboard.render_carousel import carousel

# Load the carousel items from a YAML file.
with open("carousel.yml") as f:
    items = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Build the carousel HTML with an id and duration (e.g., 5000 ms).
html_output = carousel("gallery-carousel", 5000, items)

# Tell Quarto to render the HTML instead of displaying raw text.
display(HTML(html_output))

### Our Vision {style="text-align: center"}

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

#### Environmental Monitoring

We believe environmental monitoring combined with sequencing has potential to be the next big idea in public health. We sequence  genetic material from sources as diverse as air, wastewater, groundwater, and seawater to identify and forecast pathogen outbreaks.

#### Open Data

We believe science progresses fastest in the open. Our projects comply with rigorous standards for data availability, including submission to public repositories like the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

#### Scientific Reproducibility

Without reproducability, science can never progress. In line with our commitment to data availability, we go to great lengths to make our analyses reproducible and transparent. We believe code will be read many more times that it will be written, which is no less true for research software.

#### Open Source

All our projects are open source with a permissive license, making it more likely that our data and methods will be re-used by future scientists. Open source also gives us tools for managing contributions from across our team and from collaborators.
